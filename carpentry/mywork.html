            <p class="object1-p">This was the ring box that I made for my wife for when I proposed. It is made out of walnut with some cherry and maple inlay on top. It was cut in a fancy design that I learned from my old boss Alan. This picture was when it was still not finished, but after a bit of sanding and some laquer, it was good to go!</p>

            <p class="object2-p">I had a friend in highschool who was really into making knives. He got into it as a hobby, but nowadays he has his own store and sells them often! When he first started out, he knew that I was into carpentry and he wanted to know if I wanted to make a box didgeridoo with him in exchange for a knife that we both make. Although the knife isn't pictured, this didgeridoo worked like a charm!</p>
        <div id="object3">
            <img src="images/jewl_box.jpg">
        </div>
            <p class="object3-p">This is the most recent thing that I've made. Living in Rexburg has taken me away from all of my tools. Fortunately, that hasn't stopped my desire to create! I bought a hand saw and a mini planer and with those I was able to make this little box that's similar to the one I made my wife. I still have this and I think I may give it away as a Christmas present, but I thought it would be cool to show off.</p>
