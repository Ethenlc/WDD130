        <p>Currently I'm living in Rexburg, Idaho with my wonderful wife pictured below. We have a cozy little place outside of town, but with the little place there isn't any room for tools or a workshop. We're only here for school and although we love it, I'm excited to go somewhere where I can make things again! In the mean time, I've been using hand tools to make little trinkets.</p>
        <p>I'm studying Software Engineering at BYU-Idaho and with the knowledge I'm learning as well as my skills as a carpenter, I've also been tinkering on a personal project to make a driving couch! It is fully remote control and besides a few kinks that need to be worked out, it runs as good as any couch.</p>
        <p>I plan on continuing carpentry as a hobby for the rest of my life. I hope it's a skill that I will always continue to develop. If you want to commission me to build something for you, please reach out! I can see what I can do and I'll do it with love. In the mean time, enjoy my website and thank you for looking.</p>
