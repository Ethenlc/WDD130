        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Ethen Campbell and I’m currently a student of Software Engineering at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I have a passion for building and that passion was especially ignited when I first started highschool. I had turned fifteen years old and I knew that I needed to get a job to keep myself busy as well as earn a little extra money. My grandparents knew that I wanted a job and they talked to a good friend of theirs named Alan. Alan was a cranky old woodworker who had been doing it his entire life. He loved the art, but he didn’t really love people. Alan wanted someone to help out around his yard though, so he agreed that I could work for him and he would pay me some money for what I did. I agreed and started out working for him by mowing his lawn and cleaning his yard. Over the next few months, Alan let me start cleaning his workshop and I was amazed at the tools he had. He showed me the things that he would make and I thought they were incredible. As he started to trust me more with taking care of his things, he eventually began to teach me how to make the things he made. He showed me how to carve, sand, measure, cut, and everything else you could think of doing. I loved being a part of his process and over the next three years, he would teach me everything that I know today. I have since taken my skills and grown them to the best of my ability with the tools that I have. I have made different projects trying to find what I love making the most. Please enjoy the following content as I enjoyed making it.</p>
